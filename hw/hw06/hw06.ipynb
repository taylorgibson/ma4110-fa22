His alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference between the two categories, specifically that he thinks that he is more likely to pick up if he has visited the area code. We are going to perform a [permutation test](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/12/1/AB_Testing.html#Permutation-Test) to test this.
