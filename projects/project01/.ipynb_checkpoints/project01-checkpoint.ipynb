Along that line, **DO NOT** reuse the variable names that we use when we grade your answers. For example, in Question 1 of the Global Poverty section, we ask you to assign an answer to `latest`.

To compute the population living in poverty from a poverty percentage, multiply by the population of the country **in that year**. This function **should not have a return statement**.
